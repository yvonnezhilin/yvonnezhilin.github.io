    <p class="p3">In Thor: The Dark World, Chris Hemsworth truly brought the character of Thor to life. His performance
        was
        powerful yet emotional, showing both the strength of a god and the heart of a son and brother. He perfectly
        balanced the action and the emotional moments, making Thor more than just a superhero — he made him someone
        audiences could connect with.
    </p>
    <p class="p4">
        In Men in Black: International, Chris showed a completely different side of his talent. As Agent H, he was
        charming, witty, and effortlessly funny. His chemistry with Tessa Thompson made the movie feel fresh and
        entertaining, and his natural charisma kept the film engaging from start to finish.
    </p>
    <p class="p5">
        In The Cabin in the Woods, even before becoming a worldwide star, Chris Hemsworth already showed how talented he
        was. His role as Curt, the confident and brave athlete, added both tension and personality to the story. He
        stood out in the ensemble cast and proved that he could handle more than just action — he could bring real
        presence to every scene he was in.</p>
